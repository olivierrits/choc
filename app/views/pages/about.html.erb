  <h2>Why choc?</h2>
  It's linked to cities!
  <br>
  <h3>Berlin</h3>
  <p>We've always been chocolate lovers. Real good chocolate is an acquired taste. Initially starting of with plain milk chocolate from the big brands like CÃ´te d'Or, Galler, etc. We first started moving up the cacao percentage chain towards the darker and purer forms of chocolate. In the spring of 2018 we went on a City Trip in Berlin. Thta was our first pivot. Stumbling upon this lovely shop <a href="https://www.winterfeldt-schokoladen.de/" target="_blank">Winterfeldt Schokoladen</a>, for the first time we discovered all new kinds of pure chocolate bars, high quality bars! e wouldn't say it's a life-changer, but a taste-changer? Yes definitely. Suddenly the good old chocolate we used to carelessly take in seemd plain an tasteless.</p>
  There is more to come, have some patience and relax, explore all our <a href="/bars">chocolate bars</a> in the meantime!
  <h3>Antwerp / Monteverde / Ghent / Brussels</h3>
